# Assemblies in C#
An assembly in C# is a compiled collection of code, data, and metadata that forms a single unit of deployment and reuse. Assemblies are the building blocks of .NET applications and can be thought of as DLLs or EXEs.

Assemblies typically contain:

*   Compiled code (e.g., classes, methods, properties)
*   Data (e.g., strings, images, configuration files)
*   Metadata (e.g., type information, method signatures, assembly attributes)

Assemblies can be:

*   **Executable assemblies** (EXEs): These are assemblies that can be run directly by the operating system.
*   **Class library assemblies** (DLLs): These are assemblies that contain reusable code and can be referenced by other assemblies.

## Private vs Internal Access Modifiers
The `private` and `internal` access modifiers differ in their scope and accessibility:

*   **Private**:
    *   Accessible only within the same class.
    *   Not accessible from other classes, even if they're in the same assembly.
    *   Used to encapsulate data and behavior within a class.
*   **Internal**:
    *   Accessible from any class within the same assembly.
    *   Not accessible from classes in other assemblies.
    *   Used to expose functionality or data to other classes within the same assembly, while keeping it hidden from external assemblies.

To illustrate the difference:

```csharp
// Assembly1.dll
public class MyClass 
{
    private void MyPrivateMethod() 
    {
        // Only accessible within MyClass
    }

    internal void MyInternalMethod() 
    {
        // Accessible from any class within Assembly1.dll
    }
}

// Assembly1.dll
public class AnotherClass 
{
    public void AnotherMethod() 
    {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        // myClass.MyPrivateMethod(); // Compiler error: inaccessible due to private modifier
        myClass.MyInternalMethod(); // Okay: accessible within same assembly
    }
}

// Assembly2.dll (references Assembly1.dll)
public class ExternalClass 
{
    public void ExternalMethod() 
    {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        // myClass.MyPrivateMethod(); // Compiler error: inaccessible due to private modifier
        // myClass.MyInternalMethod(); // Compiler error: inaccessible due to internal modifier
    }
}
```

## Private vs Internal Access Modifiers (Continued)

In this example, `MyPrivateMethod` is only accessible within `MyClass`, while `MyInternalMethod` is accessible from any class within `Assembly1.dll`, but not from classes in `Assembly2.dll`.

## When to Use Private and Internal

*   Use `private` when:
	+ You want to encapsulate data or behavior within a class.
	+ You want to ensure that a member is only accessible within the same class.
*   Use `internal` when:
	+ You want to expose functionality or data to other classes within the same assembly.
	+ You want to keep a member hidden from external assemblies.

## Example Use Case

Suppose you're building a library that provides a `Logger` class, and you want to expose a `LogMessage` method to other classes within the same assembly, but keep the underlying logging implementation private.

```csharp
// Logger.cs (in Assembly1.dll)
public class Logger 
{
    private void WriteLogMessage(string message) 
    {
        // Private implementation details
    }

    internal void LogMessage(string message) 
    {
        WriteLogMessage(message);
    }
}

// AnotherClass.cs (in Assembly1.dll)
public class AnotherClass 
{
    public void DoSomething() 
    {
        Logger logger = new Logger();
        logger.LogMessage("Doing something"); // Okay: accessible within same assembly
    }
}

// ExternalClass.cs (in Assembly2.dll, references Assembly1.dll)
public class ExternalClass 
{
    public void DoSomethingElse() 
    {
        Logger logger = new Logger();
        // logger.LogMessage("Doing something else"); // Compiler error: inaccessible due to internal modifier
    }
}
```

In this example, the `LogMessage` method is exposed to other classes within `Assembly1.dll`, but the underlying `WriteLogMessage` method is kept private. The `ExternalClass` in `Assembly2.dll` cannot access the `LogMessage` method due to the `internal` access modifier.

By using `private` and `internal` access modifiers, you can control the visibility and accessibility of your code, making it more modular, maintainable, and secure.
